Friendly and not cantankerous members are suitable for me; however, I trust I am a tolerant person so if they make something worse but not over the limit then it's still acceptable without any conflicts. With my personality: excited with new ideas, not afraid of difficulties, working hard, follow the rules and deadlines seriously, I believe that I will be an indispensable member of every team.</p>

As we know, taking home plenty of gadgets patterns to try out all the collaboration in the owner area is problematic. This application allows you to put the environment of your room into the phone’s screen, then you can change the background wall color, move the bed’s position, add or remove the table and chair, etc without delivering those directly to your house.</p>

One of the technological peaks that are gradually becoming a trend of social development is augmented reality (AR).  As everyone knows, customizing your own room in various ideas with reality technologies is more actual, more saving, safer and faster, that help customers and sellers avoid a bunch of problems such as time-wasting, fee shipping, health, etc. This application is a quality project for a start-up mobile company because it can earn money by collaborating with furniture shops, or restore or customize factories.</p>

                    <p class="card-text">Firstly, this app requires a smartphone or a tablet that has ARKit or ARCore assistant, so this can 
                        connect your phone to the practical environment with AR technology. Then, we will need to turn on the camera, scanning 
                        around your space slowly and moving 360 degrees, to create a 3D environment, after that the system will start to analyze 
                        the data of that scanned area. Once the system has completed analyzing the data, the room space detail will be saved into 
                        application memory, this helps you not need to do step one again. You can open resources and pick which spaces you want to 
                        try furniture on.
                    </p>
                    <p class="card-text">Secondly, connecting your chosen space to the furniture companies that you are going to buy, picking a 
                        style you love, 
                        they will provide you dozens of trials that you can play around with wall painting colors, textures, cabinets, tools, etc 
                        in a 3D environment. Moreover, this app will recommend which materials are suitable for your kind of ground, wall, and 
                        space based on the analyzed data. Also, they will show popular ideas from trending rooms for you to compare. All these 
                        functions ensure your room design will be furnished fully and appointed perfectly.</p>

                        and REVIT to create 3D gadgets based on the requirements of the company. VR technology is also a compulsory tool that 
                        can combine the real and virtual world and real-time interaction, which helps this room design app succeed almost 
                        completely. The more grown edition of your phone’s camera, the more convenient it is for you to move, drag, remove, 
                        expand and shrink everything smoothly without bug error, for example, ARKit tool of iPhone from iPhone 8 with iOS 11

                        good experiments for users. I also need to learn more about reality technologies and about design programs which is also

                        on the phone’s screen, sharing and giving opinions without conflicting or putting much effort. This development helps not

                    I should promote the marketing aspect as it won't reach many users and sellers, I hope by that time, online advertising 
                    will have accessible to all types of users from young to old age. One of the things I should be more concerned with is 
                    pricing and fees for using, upgrading and repairing VR and AR tools. These tools are not really developed much at this point,

                <h5 class="card-title">What does it do?</h5>
                <p class="card-text">Virtual Reality (English: Virtual Reality - VR) is a mock-up experience that can be the same or fully 
                    dissimilar from the actual world. In addition to creating virtual spaces, VR technology can actually interact with users 
                    through gestures and many different senses such as hearing, smell, and touch. At this moment, it serves many areas, such 
                    as entertainment, education, medical, and even military. For example, the application of virtual reality in education is 
                    a breakthrough in teaching methods, new approaches for learners and teachers, instead of learning theory, it will move to 
                    practical learning, practical experience through 3D simulation, LAB rooms, so the lessons and knowledge will be realistic, 
                    detailed, quick to understand, easy to remember, attracting learners, much higher efficiency. times compared to the old way. 
                    On the other hand, VR would bring strongly interact with human feelings, if watching a simulated movie with VR glasses, users 
                    can move around the movie space, can turn their head to the left, to the right to change the viewing angle. As for a regular 
                    movie, that is completely impossible. Moreover, some special VR virtual reality systems will integrate many more factors 
                    such as wind, water, light effects, vibration, etc to increase user’s emotions when using VR. In the next 3 years, I believe 
                    the next social media is a presence of VR world. Imagine where a brand could invite their brand ambassadors to try a product 
                    without getting on a plane? A place where a brand can convey press releases but not with pre-written ones but actually be 
                    there to share the news with the community of journalists and meet each other in social VR. There are many opportunities for 
                    brands and content creators.

                <h5 class="card-title">What is the likely impact ?</h5>
                <p class="card-text">VR technology has big influences on human feelings, emotions, and awareness. This tool causes health harm, 
                    for instance, if you use virtual reality glasses and stuck in the VR world for over 30 minutes, you will get dizziness, 
                    disorientation, and even vomiting like when people feel carsick. In the VR world or when watching a 3D movie, only your 
                    eyes and ears receive information, but this information is not like the other senses do. In theory, you should feel tired 
                    after a long period of lack of synchronization between the senses. However, from the start, this tool has been useful for 
                    connecting people closer through a virtual presence. The pandemic is causing many people to stay at home, limit physical 
                    contact, and social contact. Family and friends connect via Zoom calls, get to a birthday party by driving over to send gifts, 
                    and leave. Experts spend countless hours on screens talking to colleagues and customers. "Tired of Zoom" is the lament of those 
                    who have to work remotely. Under such conditions, it is found that "presence" is more important than ever. Being in space - the 
                    feeling of "being there" thanks to a virtual space can help people living in a pandemic-affected and physically distant world feel 
                    satisfied by having a social experience.

                    delivering immersive experience and even transformative feature. From helping people from introverts overcoming fear in a 
                    secure virtual space to providing lifesaving training, life skills, the scope of VR is unlimited. Using VR reasonably will 
                    give me a better experience to relax because this helps me learn and discover many things practically which used to be theory 
                    in books, for example, knowing how smart technologies work, easier to study history, etc.
